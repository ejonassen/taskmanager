ERIC JONASSEN - PROJECT 4

URL: http://www.taskmanager.ericwebapps.me

My Project 4 is a take on the suggested final project of a Task Manager app. This app allows a user to create an account,
and manage his/her own tasks. This includes the ability to mark as completed, edit a task, or delete a task. One may view tasks either
all at a time, only active tasks, or only completed tasks, and both the date of creation and the date of last update are tracked. All tasks
are sorted by last-updated in descending order, and when viewing all tasks at once, tasks are sorted first by active, then by last
updated.

For an already populated tasklist, one may log into:
user: user1
password: pass1
